## Warnings

**Hold on !** This is a huge work in progress where features and supported languages
depending on expectations from Literate. This may change after the first major release.
For now, weâ€™re only interested in translating to JavaScript and Kotlin but Swift support should come soon.

## Motivation

At [LiterateInk](https://literate.ink), we're writing librairies targetting multiple languages to provide support for most platforms.

For example, we absolutely need a JavaScript version for [Papillon](https://papillon.bzh), a Kotlin version for [Literate Android](https://github.com/LiterateInk/LiterateAndroid) and a Swift version for [Literate iOS](https://github.com/LiterateInk/LiterateIOS).

Before, we had a Rust structure with [`uniffi-rs`](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs) for Kotlin and Swift paired with `wasm-bindgen` to provide JavaScript bindings through WASM.

We ran into an issue where [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) was **NOT supporting WASM**, and even plugins to support it were doing nothing. To prevent this, we decided to move on and rewrite the library to JavaScript for Papillon. It was not a really fun process since we had to manage multiple codebases at once.

## What is inklang ?

Inklang is a language that compiles to whatever language you want that is supported.
It is designed to be simple and easy to use.
